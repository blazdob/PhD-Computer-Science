# PhD-Computer-Science
This is the general repository and scope of work within my doctoral studies.

## Research

My main work is focuesd on machine learning and data science. I am currently working on the following topics:
* Argumentation in Machine Learning
* Implicit Concept Detection
* Explainable AI
* Explainable Reinforcement Learning
* Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Working repositories

* [XRL self driving car environment](https://github.com/blazdob/XRL-self-driving-car-LRP-and-prototypes) - This work contains explanations using two techniques: **LRP** and Human-defined **Prototypes**
* [Persistance Guided Neural networks](https://github.com/blazdob/Persistence-diagram-guided-neural-network) - This work contains the work on persistence diagram detection and how they can guide the Deep Learning process.
* [XRL concepts in voltage control](https://github.com/blazdob/RL_Concept_DSO_Network) - This work contains the concept detection in Reinforcement Learning environment for voltage control in low voltage distribution network.
